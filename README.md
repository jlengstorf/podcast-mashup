### Episode Description

> In this episode, Sean Grove (https://twitter.com/sgrove) teaches us how to use OneGraph — a super powerful way to combine data from lots of different apps into a single, unified GraphQL API — in a Gatsby app that loads the latest from a few of our favorite podcasts. We even set up webhooks to automatically rebuild the site whenever a new episode is available!
